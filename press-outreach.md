## Warm Intro Email (copy-paste ready)

**From:** jh8670@nyu.edu
**To:** [paste email]
**Subject:** Interactive globe — every 2026 Olympic medalist mapped to their hometown

Hi,

The Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics just wrapped — I mapped every medalist back to the city they grew up in on an interactive 3D globe.

Take a look: https://hyperloco-llc.github.io/olympics-2026/

~350 athletes, 30+ countries, arc lines connecting hometowns to Cortina d'Ampezzo. A few things that pop: Norway's cross-country cluster, Lucas Braathen's arc stretching from Oslo to Brazil, and ski mountaineering's first-ever Olympic medals from tiny Alpine towns.

I'm a GIS designer and professor at NYU — this is a project from my studio HYPERLOCO, where we build interactive geospatial stories. Happy to chat a feature, licensing, or whatever makes sense.

Hi — just bumping this. The map's been getting traction and I'd love for [Outlet] to take a look before the Olympics news cycle wraps.
